We would like to stress that the code and work included in this repo and workshop is experimental. It was not reviewed by a peer assessment process. The code, examples and work should be considered accordingly. The work is meant for illustrative and educational purposes.

## MLTOX
Welcome to the workshop on "Machine Learning in Toxicology" (mltox).
This Workshop consists of 4 learning activities:

 1. Introduction to R and RStudio
 1. An introduction to Tidymodels in R (adapted from the Tidymodels documentation)
 1. An introduction to Machine Learning approaches for classification of chemicals
 1. Introduction to deep learning

If you already are familiar with the R and the `{tidymodels}` workflow, you might want to skip or only glimpse over activities 1 and/or 2.

You can find these lessons in the menu on the left. Each lesson starts with a short introduction by the teachers. After that, you are supposed to study the lessons yourself and make the exercises. During the lessons, you can ask questions to the teachers and the teachers will provide feedback. 

Please note: this is a crash course. We scheduled this course to allow you to throw yourself into R and be able to see yourself making progress very quickly. 

We wish you good luck and we hope you will have a lot of fun with R!

## Course material

The course material consists of the following:

- Instruction pages (menu to the left). 
- Exercises.

For a very good resource on using R in Data Science we highly recommend getting a copy of this book:
 [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). Part 2is based on the [Tidymodels documentation](https://www.tidymodels.org/). 
 
Part 2 was adapted from [TAME]

## Recommended reading
To read up on AI in Toxicology, I recommend these papers as a starting point:

 * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10616238/
 * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710127/
 * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9609874/
 
For a recent practical studie where Machine Learning was use to predict half life of PFAS, see:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9962572/

## R and RStudio

During the course, we will use R in the Integrated Development Environment  **RStudio**, which you can download and install for your system using the links below:

To make things more easy and avoid installation issues, we will use an online Cloud version of RStudio running in Posit Cloud.
You will get the login details at the start of the course. The server will remain runing for a while after the course, but you might want to install the software locally yourself to keep on using it.

Download R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
Download RStudio [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

## Resources and Bookdown
This website has been created using the `{bookdown}` R package
```{r}
citation(package = "bookdown")
```
I you want to learn more on bookdown, see [this link](https://bookdown.org/)

## Learning objectives

After this course, you will be able to 

- Explain the basics of machine learning and Deep learning in toxicology.
- use R to perform a structure-based Generalised Read Across
- Build a classical Machine Learning model and evaluate its performance
- Run model-tuning to find optimal hyperparameters
